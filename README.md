# Unveiling-Deep-Shadows: A Survey on Image and Video Shadow Detection, Removal, and Generation in the Era of Deep Learning

This repository contains the codebase for deep models used in shadow detection, removal, and generation, as presented in our paper "Unveiling Deep Shadows: A Survey on Image and Video Shadow Detection, Removal, and Generation in the Era of Deep Learning." In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of shadow detection, removal, and generation in both images and videos in the era of deep learning over the past decade, encompassing tasks, deep models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Key contributions include a thorough investigation of overfitting challenges, meticulous scrutiny of dataset quality, in-depth exploration of relationships between model size, speed, and performance, and a comprehensive cross-dataset generalization study.
